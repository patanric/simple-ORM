#Simple ORM
This is a simple ORM implementation like for example Hibernate or EclipseLink is done.
Just much simpler to demonstrate the usage of the reflection API

## H2 database
1. Create DB file: `src/db-files/db-orm.mv.db`
1. Update URL in the EntityManager (without .mv.db): `jdbc:h2:<path-to>/src/db-files/db-orm`
1. Start the DBLauncher.
1. Use same URL as the EntityManager to connect with browser to DB: `jdbc:h2:<path-to>/src/db-files/db-orm`
1. Create table:
```
create table Person (
    k_id int primary key,
    c_name varchar(40),
    c_age int
)
```

## Run the ORM
Once the H2 database is setup, disconnect the browser client to be able to run:
1. WritingObjects
1. ReadingObjects

Verify the the information in the standard output.
